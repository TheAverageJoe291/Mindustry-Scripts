# Mindustry-Install-Script

Your everyday basic script for downloading Mindustry for Linux :)

The game is in the folder it added to the ~/Desktop folder, should be on Desktop.
Just go into the folder using file manager and launch the game using the executable file for the game.
I DID NOT tamper with the game, trust me, if I knew java, I would make my own games.
Threw in echo commands on what its doing, along with random sleep commands too.
Information on how/what it does is below.

Information on what the script does!

It should do...
1. Go to Downloads folder...
2. Downloads the game from Google Drive (Don't know how to download from itch.io)...
3. Unzips game
4. Renames folder
5. Moves game to Desktop in its own folder
6. Deletes the stuff it used from Downloads folder
7. Welp, it's done, I think
